* Overview
This emits events into a kafka topic for bungee.

* Events
** DONE PlayerConnected
Message is published when a player connects to a bungeecord network.
#+begin_src json
{
  "eventType": "PLAYER_CONNECTED",
  "playerUUID": "string",
  "playerName": "string"
}
#+end_src
** DONE PlayerDisconnected
Message is published when a player disconnects from a bungeecord network.
  #+begin_src json
  {
    "eventType": "PLAYER_DISCONNECTED",
    "playerUUID": "string",
    "playerName": "string"
  }
  #+end_src

* TODO Plugin Commands
Interaction with the plugin should be simple, where the jar file itself is just placed within the plugin directory
for bukkit.

From within the game, an op level user may use the following commands:
- /mcevents connect <server name> <kafka url> :: Which will establish the name of the server
  and connect to the kafka system to publish and listen for messages.
- /mcevents disconnect :: which will clear the config.
